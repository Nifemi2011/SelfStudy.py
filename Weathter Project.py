 #- Importing function - this allows us to import code from a diffrent script and use it in our current script.
#- def function -  allows to define a paricular line of code that we want to run/ generate in our code.
# - Try & except function- also like if & else statements allows us to be able to use more defined coding in our script in order to get a more deeper explanation in our line of code.
